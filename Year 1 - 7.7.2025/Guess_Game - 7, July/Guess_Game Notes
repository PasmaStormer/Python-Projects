Project: Number Guessing Game  
Date: 7 July 2025  

Concepts used:
- while loops
- if/elif/else conditions
- input validation
- random number generation
- variables and counters

What I learned:
I built a working number guessing game that tells the player if their guess is too high or too low. 
Later, I added a limit of 5 tries and printed how many attempts it took. 
I learned how to use while loops, conditions, and how to break out when the game is won.
I found while loops the hardest to keep in my head.
