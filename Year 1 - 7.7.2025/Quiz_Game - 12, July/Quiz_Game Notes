Project: Quiz Game  
Date: 12 July 2025  

Concepts used:
- Functions (`def`, `return`, parameters)
- Lists (to store answer choices)
- Loops (`for` to show options, `while` to validate input)
- Input validation (`isdigit()`, range checks)
- if/else conditions
- f-strings for formatted printing

What I learned:
This was my biggest project so far. 
I first made it with a lot of help from GPT. 
It involved many different concepts like loops, lists, and input validation all working together, which felt overwhelming at first.

I later decided to rebuild the entire quiz **without help**, to prove to myself I actually understood how it all fits together. 
I made a `greet_user()` function, an `ask_question()` function with input checking, and a `run_quiz()` function that totals the score and shows the result.

I now understand:
- Why we use `+=` instead of just `+`
- Why we use `.isdigit()` to avoid errors when converting input
- How to return values and use them in another function

Next time, Iâ€™ll try adding feedback after each answer and maybe even randomizing the questions.
