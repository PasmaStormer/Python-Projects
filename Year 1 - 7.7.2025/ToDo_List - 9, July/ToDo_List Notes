Project: To-Do List App  
Date: 7 July 2025  

Concepts used:
- Lists
- while loops
- if/elif/else for menu options
- `append()`, `remove()`, and `for` loops
- User input and input validation basics

What I learned:
This was my first multi-option program. 
I created a menu that runs in a loop and lets the user add tasks, view all tasks, and remove a task. 
I learned how to store tasks in a list and interact with it using `append()` and `remove()`. 
I also practiced looping through lists with `for` loops and handling user choices using `if/elif`.

Possible improvements:
- Input validation for task removal
- Numbering tasks in the list
- Saving tasks to a file so they don't disappear after quitting
